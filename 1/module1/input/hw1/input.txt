this is the class that Han Solo would be. a sneaky little computer hacker,
smuggler, security breaking artist. these are the rogues of the KotOR KotOR KotOR universe
and i know you guys like rogues. they are interesting to play and add a
challenge to the game not before seen by the other 2 classes. but is this
challenge weakness? i dont think it is weakness, i dont see any potential class
build as weak unless you really are horrible at making characters. they
specialize in the art of stealth and persuasion. they are they exact opposite
of a soldier and have amazing skill progression.
