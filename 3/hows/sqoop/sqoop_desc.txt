Selected  mappers count:
Whe have 12 files to parse, on real cluster we, most likely, should use 12 mappers (one for each input file).
However, on local instance optimal speed provided by 4 mappers (4 CPU cores).
On local environment  mappers seems to be optimal.
to get optimal processing speed.
- tested on 1 mapper, whole process took ~55 minutes (see screen shots).
- tested on 4 mappers, execution time reduced significantly, down to ~20 minutes (see screen shots, add +10 mins, staging table was empty), ~30 min total,
  but it takes lots of additional CPU and Memory resources overhead.
- tested on 12 mappers, execution time ~55 minutes (see screen shots).
  same as 4 mappers, further increase in CPU an Memory overhead.

sqoop command description:
--connect - specified mysql DB address and target table.
--connection-manager - required for staging support, provides driver, etc.
--table - target table.
--staging-table - table sqoop writes into. 
  Staging table must share exact same definition as target table,
  used to prevent data corruption if sqoop export command fails in the middle of the execution.
  Loaded data moved to target table right after sqoop job is completed.
--clear-staging-table - specify this property to enusre staging table truncated before fresh data load.
--export-dir - directory with input data.
--options-file - file with parameters (credentials in this case).
  One line = one parameter OR value, not both.
--num-mappers - simply number of mappers.
--input-fields-terminated-by - input values delimiter char.

Loads data from files in pointed directory, writes them into staging table using MR tasks, when done,
migrates data into target table.
