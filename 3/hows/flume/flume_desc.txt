Source:
Sopooling provides much more reliability, but we can't use it in this case - it supports only immutable files.
Exec source can be used with tail -F [file] command, so we can read constantly updated file, but it
can lead to data consistency issues - if channel fills up, we lose data without knowing about it.
So our option here is Taildir - this source is reliable and will not miss data in case of agent or it's 
components restart or fail.

Channel:
In-memory channel. Our data flow is not big, so we can store it in memory to provide additional speed,
however, in case of channel drop or overflow we will lose un-sinked data.

Sink:
Task requires sinking output to HDFS, so we simply using HDFS Sink.
Timestamps are used from message's headers to generate neat file structure.
